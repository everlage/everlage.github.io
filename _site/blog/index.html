<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>Undergrad students have priority registration for upper division classes.
Unfortunately for me, <a href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/schedule/subdet.aspx?srs=187510200&amp;term=12S">Programming Languages</a> was full long before
my enrollment appointment.  Even worse, the professor informed us that
he would be unable to give out any PTEs (special code to enroll in a class that is already at capacity)
because of the sheer volume of students interested in enrolling.
Usually, attending the lectures and asking is all it takes to get a PTE.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/schedule/schedulehome.aspx">UCLA Registrar</a> publishes enrollment counts in real time. One option was
to incessantly check the page. That’s tedious and boring. I’m lazy. I wrote a small script that uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> to download a given page, <code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to search for the word “Open”, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mail</code> to alert me. A little-known fact is all US
cell phone carriers have a way to send text messages from an email address.
This happened to be beneficial because I get too much email to constantly check my inbox. Text messages to my phone will be seen by me almost instantly. The next step was to add a crontab that calls the alerter script every minute.</p>

<h2><a href="/2012/01/07/ios-introduces-native-geocoding.html">iOS 5.0 Introduces Native Geocoding</a></h2>
<span class="date">Sat, Jan 07, 2012</span>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://github.com/derrickj/DJGeocoder/commit/366391873b975417b6894782e0c2d6026d5a60eb">March 27, 2011</a> to be exact, I released <a href="https://github.com/derrickj/DJGeocoder">DJGeocoder</a>,
an open source Objective-C class that allows you to cleanly geocode
street addresses in an iOS app. I wrote it back then because <a href="/regions">Regions</a> needed it, and surprisingly, it wasn’t built into MapKit.</p>

<p>Last night, I was playing around with a re-write, and discovered Apple’s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLGeocoder_class/Reference/Reference.html">CLGeocoder</a>, introduced in iOS 5. I won’t be updating DJGeocoder. It is still useful if you need to support iOS versions prior to iOS 5. Otherwise, just use the newly introduced native API.</p>

<p>e-Greeting cards allows you to send personalized electronic greeting cards to the people you care about. It will be released soon. <a href="https://testflightapp.com/join/408c78e8819e1427cacdef37f079159b-MTc0MzU/">Sign up for the beta</a> if you’re interested in checking it out before it get’s released.</p>

<p>Somehow, I forgot to post this to the blog. I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/derricck/status/121748403926478848">tweeted</a> about it 4 months ago though. I don’t think the readership is particularly high, but I definitely should have posted here.</p>

<p>P.S. I started working on this <em>before</em> Apple announced it’s own <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/apps-by-apple/cards.html">Cards app</a>. Since my app was almost done before the announcement, and they send printed cards, I decided not to scrap the project all together. Needless to say, this should be interesting.</p>

<h2><a href="/2011/06/06/how-ios5-affects-regions.html">How iOS 5 Affects Regions</a></h2>
<span class="date">Mon, Jun 06, 2011</span>
<h3 id="ios-5-probably-just-made-my-app-pointless">iOS 5 probably just made my app pointless.</h3>

<p>I started working on <a href="http://itunes.com/app/regions">Regions</a> in my free time as soon
as iOS 4.0 brought new background location APIs to the table. The app has had
a few issues.
The most glaring problem was that any iOS device could download it from the app store,
even though it is only available for iPhone 4.
I’m almost done with finals, so I was planning on doing the following this summer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Refining the User Interface to make some of the features more obvious</li>
  <li>Re-releasing Regions under a new name (the only way to fix the app store availability problem)</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn’t want to promote my app without completing these two steps.</p>

<p>I decided  to check out the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/about/">WWDC</a> news, and found out that built-in location based
reminders would be included in the next major release of iOS. Naturally, <a href="https://twitter.com/derricck/status/77814397338255362">I was slightly upset</a>;
But not as much as my friends thought I would be. I understand that this
sort of thing happens all the time. Regions was not the only app in its category.
What it provides is a very useful, so it makes sense that many other people would
want to provide the same feature. Why would Apple be any different?</p>

<p>Another example of this is the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/06/apple-adds-camera-shortcut-to-lock-screen-volume-up-shutter-key/">volume shutter feature</a> in Camera+ that was <a href="http://taptaptap.com/blog/cameraplus-volumesnap-rejected/">rejected last year</a>. Yet another example of an idea that is on one
hand very clever, but is also bound to be thought of by multiple people.</p>

<p>Today, I finally received a response (under NDA of course) about my
<a href="/2010/12/17/improving-regions.html">bug report</a>. There is some good news to
take out of this. The built-in support should be awesome. I’ve always wanted
this feature, and now everyone else will get it as well.</p>

<p>Regarding built-in features cannibalizing special apps, there
is a small chance that this will increase demand for my app.
Marco Arment has <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/06/06/safari-reader-and-instapaper">a post explaining why</a> that may be the case for Instapaper.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-this-mean-for-regions">What does this mean for Regions?</h3>

<p>It means that I probably won’t be updating it over the summer. I’ll wait and see
how the feature turns out when I start using iOS 5. I only have one iPhone 4, which
I use as my personal phone, so I don’t install iOS betas on it.
If there ends up being an opportunity for Regions to fill a niche, then
I will reconsider actively developing it. People that want to
have location based reminders before iOS 5 gets released this Fall
can <a href="http://itunes.com/app/regions">download Regions from the app store now</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not at <a href="http://sxsw.com/">South By Southwest</a>, this is about the time where you entire twitter timeline reminds you of it. If you don’t to want to see all those #SXSW tweets, then Calloway 1.1 is just for you. <a href="http://hillcrestlab.com/resources/calloway.safariextz">Download and install this Safari Extension</a>, and you won’t see any tweets containing “sxsw”, or “SXSW”, or “SxSW” (you get the idea).</p>

<h2><a href="/2011/03/03/first-testflight-beta.html">First Testflight Beta</a></h2>
<span class="date">Thu, Mar 03, 2011</span>
<p>Despite me being extremely busy with finals coming around the corner and volunteering, I had an urge to push out a beta build of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/regions/id392441093">Regions</a> to the people that signed up at <a href="http://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a>. As I said before, I dumped out all my old code, which meant dumping out a lot of features when I started from the Apple example code. One of the simple (and essential) functions was playing a sound in addition to the pop-up alert when you receive a reminder. I noticed the lack of sound several times while on my bus. It got the job done for me since I was staring at my phone anyway, but this was obviously a short-coming.</p>

<p>Since I don’t have time to do a more substantial update, this is a nice excuse for me to checkout how pushing out updates via Testflight is. I can safely describe it as a cross between awesome and beautiful. If you’d like to try out new features before they are released to the app store, <a href="http://testflightapp.com/join/58ec4b848be2c155c68078d6cf4d1809-MTA3OA/">sign up to be a beta tester</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a quite a things that remain undone on my site. Until now, I wasn’t happy with how my contact info was presented. It almost feels like something is missing if there aren’t links to a few (or dozen) social networking sites. I did a quick search, and found some that I really liked from <a href="http://www.komodomedia.com">http://www.komodomedia.com</a>. They are free of charge. They only ask that you link back to their site if you used them. Pretty awesome.</p>

<p>In an <a href="/2011/01/03/regions-soft-relaunch.html">earlier post</a>, I mentioned how it looked like <a href="http://www.testflightapp.com">TestFlight</a> would be taking a lot of pain out of running beta tests. They are already off to a great start. I’ll be adding some new features to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/regions/id392441093">Regions</a>, and I would love to get them in the hands of users before it gets to the app store.</p>
