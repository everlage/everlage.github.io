<span class="date">Mon, Jun 06, 2011</span>
<h3 id="ios-5-probably-just-made-my-app-pointless">iOS 5 probably just made my app pointless.</h3>

<p>I started working on <a href="http://itunes.com/app/regions">Regions</a> in my free time as soon
as iOS 4.0 brought new background location APIs to the table. The app has had
a few issues.
The most glaring problem was that any iOS device could download it from the app store,
even though it is only available for iPhone 4.
I’m almost done with finals, so I was planning on doing the following this summer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Refining the User Interface to make some of the features more obvious</li>
  <li>Re-releasing Regions under a new name (the only way to fix the app store availability problem)</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn’t want to promote my app without completing these two steps.</p>

<p>I decided  to check out the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/about/">WWDC</a> news, and found out that built-in location based
reminders would be included in the next major release of iOS. Naturally, <a href="https://twitter.com/derricck/status/77814397338255362">I was slightly upset</a>;
But not as much as my friends thought I would be. I understand that this
sort of thing happens all the time. Regions was not the only app in its category.
What it provides is a very useful, so it makes sense that many other people would
want to provide the same feature. Why would Apple be any different?</p>

<p>Another example of this is the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/06/apple-adds-camera-shortcut-to-lock-screen-volume-up-shutter-key/">volume shutter feature</a> in Camera+ that was <a href="http://taptaptap.com/blog/cameraplus-volumesnap-rejected/">rejected last year</a>. Yet another example of an idea that is on one
hand very clever, but is also bound to be thought of by multiple people.</p>

<p>Today, I finally received a response (under NDA of course) about my
<a href="/2010/12/17/improving-regions.html">bug report</a>. There is some good news to
take out of this. The built-in support should be awesome. I’ve always wanted
this feature, and now everyone else will get it as well.</p>

<p>Regarding built-in features cannibalizing special apps, there
is a small chance that this will increase demand for my app.
Marco Arment has <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/06/06/safari-reader-and-instapaper">a post explaining why</a> that may be the case for Instapaper.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-this-mean-for-regions">What does this mean for Regions?</h3>

<p>It means that I probably won’t be updating it over the summer. I’ll wait and see
how the feature turns out when I start using iOS 5. I only have one iPhone 4, which
I use as my personal phone, so I don’t install iOS betas on it.
If there ends up being an opportunity for Regions to fill a niche, then
I will reconsider actively developing it. People that want to
have location based reminders before iOS 5 gets released this Fall
can <a href="http://itunes.com/app/regions">download Regions from the app store now</a>.</p>
