[e-Greeting Cards 1.1](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/e-greeting-cards/id470336073?ls=1&amp;mt=8) is available in the app store! I've made a [promo site](http://www.egreetingsapp.com/) for it was well. There, you can find a [demo video](http://www.egreetingsapp.com/#video) to see how it works. The content layout adapts to screen sizes. So wether you're on a desktop, mobile phone, or anything in between, it should look great.
