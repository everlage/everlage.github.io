If you are not at [South By Southwest](http://sxsw.com/), this is about the time where you entire twitter timeline reminds you of it. If you don't to want to see all those #SXSW tweets, then Calloway 1.1 is just for you. [Download and install this Safari Extension](http://hillcrestlab.com/resources/calloway.safariextz), and you won't see any tweets containing "sxsw", or "SXSW", or "SxSW" (you get the idea).
