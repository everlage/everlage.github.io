Despite me being extremely busy with finals coming around the corner and volunteering, I had an urge to push out a beta build of [Regions](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/regions/id392441093) to the people that signed up at [TestFlight](http://testflightapp.com/). As I said before, I dumped out all my old code, which meant dumping out a lot of features when I started from the Apple example code. One of the simple (and essential) functions was playing a sound in addition to the pop-up alert when you receive a reminder. I noticed the lack of sound several times while on my bus. It got the job done for me since I was staring at my phone anyway, but this was obviously a short-coming.

Since I don't have time to do a more substantial update, this is a nice excuse for me to checkout how pushing out updates via Testflight is. I can safely describe it as a cross between awesome and beautiful. If you'd like to try out new features before they are released to the app store, [sign up to be a beta tester](http://testflightapp.com/join/58ec4b848be2c155c68078d6cf4d1809-MTA3OA/).
