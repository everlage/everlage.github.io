In an [earlier post](/2011/01/03/regions-soft-relaunch.html), I mentioned how it looked like [TestFlight](http://www.testflightapp.com) would be taking a lot of pain out of running beta tests. They are already off to a great start. I'll be adding some new features to [Regions](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/regions/id392441093), and I would love to get them in the hands of users before it gets to the app store.

If you'd like to try it out, [sign up to be a beta tester!](http://testflightapp.com/join/58ec4b848be2c155c68078d6cf4d1809-MTA3OA/).
