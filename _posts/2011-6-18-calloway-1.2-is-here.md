What's New:

* Block icons from @PT_Callway instead of @Mr_Calloway (he changed his name)
* No longer need to block South by Southwest tweets
* Use CSS instead of JavaScript to block (should be more efficient)

[Download the Calloway extension](/resources/calloway.safariextz).

[View the code on Github](https://github.com/derrickj/calloway.safariextension).
