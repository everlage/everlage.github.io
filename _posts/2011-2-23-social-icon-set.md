There's a quite a things that remain undone on my site. Until now, I wasn't happy with how my contact info was presented. It almost feels like something is missing if there aren't links to a few (or dozen) social networking sites. I did a quick search, and found some that I really liked from <http://www.komodomedia.com>. They are free of charge. They only ask that you link back to their site if you used them. Pretty awesome.
