title: Accepting e-Greeting Cards Beta Testers
---

e-Greeting cards allows you to send personalized electronic greeting cards to the people you care about. It will be released soon. [Sign up for the beta](https://testflightapp.com/join/408c78e8819e1427cacdef37f079159b-MTc0MzU/) if you're interested in checking it out before it get's released.

Somehow, I forgot to post this to the blog. I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/derricck/status/121748403926478848) about it 4 months ago though. I don't think the readership is particularly high, but I definitely should have posted here.

P.S. I started working on this *before* Apple announced it's own [Cards app](http://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/apps-by-apple/cards.html). Since my app was almost done before the announcement, and they send printed cards, I decided not to scrap the project all together. Needless to say, this should be interesting.
