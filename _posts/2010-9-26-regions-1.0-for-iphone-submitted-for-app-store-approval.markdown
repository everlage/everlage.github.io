title: Regions 1.0 for iPhone Submitted for App Store Approval
---
Title says it all. Let’s see how long this takes. I recommend following the instructions for setting up a distribution profile in XCode precisely. Saving the instructions as a PDF produced a whopping 17 pages! Figuring out which of the 20-30 steps you missed after your app signing fails is not fun.

I still haven’t received a response from Apple regarding what looks like a bug. For now, I have to limit the number of location based reminders that can be set. Who knows how long I’ll have to wait for this issue to be addressed. I felt like I needed to go ahead and get 1.0 in the store so people can check it out.
