### Test Location Based Code on the iPhone Simulator

We all know the iPhone simulator is all but useless for testing location based code. To remedy this, I’ve created a simple simple Objective-C category that you can use to simulate location changes. It’s not over engineered. You don’t have to go figure out a weird file format then edit that file to get it to work. Just program your routes.

The code is on [github](http://github.com/derrickj/iphone-geospoof/).
