I submitted Regions a little before I started school. Due to some [bugs](http://openradar.appspot.com/8351167) in the Region Monitoring API, and my lack of thorough testing on iOS 4.1, it was unreliable. I wasn't able to work on it during school, and didn't want to delete my App and risk losing the name. I resorted to posting a message in the description that basically said, "Please don't download this."

While listening to [Build and Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/5) I found that it is possible to pull your app without deleting it. This is done by setting he availability date to some time in the future. Regions will not return to the store until it's ready. If you'd like to do some beta testing, [create an account](http://www.hillcrestlab.com/redmine/account/register). If you don't get a response within a few days, <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#058;&#100;&#101;&#114;&#114;&#105;&#099;&#107;&#064;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#099;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#108;&#097;&#098;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">send me an e-mail</a>.
