I made a safari extension that blocks one of my buddy's twitter icons. I'm not providing a link to his page because you'd click on it, and *truly* understand why I made this. I don't want to do that to you. There's certain things you can't unsee; So just trust me: You **do not** want to see his icons.

### Future

I might add other features. The most important thing was to block his images! The code is on [github](https://github.com/derrickj/calloway.safariextension).
