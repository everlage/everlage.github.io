<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2 class="faq">Why can't I pick a location other than my current location?</h2>
<p>Actually, you can! Pan to a new location by dragging the map just like the built-in Maps app. Touching the '+' button always drops the pin in the center of the screen. If you wish, you can drag the pin to finely adjust the location.</p>

<h2 class="faq">Can you please allow me to make reminders with a radius smaller than 1000 meters?</h2>
Unfortunately, no. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/regions/id392441093">Regions</a> uses background locations services introduced in iOS 4.0. <em>At best</em>, you can expect <a href="http://longweekendmobile.com/2010/07/22/iphone-background-gps-accurate-to-500-meters-not-enough-for-foot-traffic/">kilometer accuracy</a>.

<h2 class="faq">Wait, so if Regions doesn't use GPS, how does it know my location?</h2>
Regions uses <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/LocationAwarenessPG/CoreLocation/CoreLocation.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009497-CH2-SW13">Apple's Region Monitoring API</a>, which uses cell tower information to triangulate your location.

<h2 class="faq">The Maps app uses GPS and pinpoints my location within a few feet, why not use GPS to be more accurate?</h2>
Regions needs to be able to alert you at any time. If it used GPS in the background, your battery would drain rapidly.
