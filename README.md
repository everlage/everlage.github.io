Editing my headers in every page started to get annoying and tedious really quickly. I could have hacked together something using sed, but decided to look around to see what was out there. I decided on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

I found [this article](http://klepas.org/jekyll-a-static-site-generator/) very useful in diving right in.

I also wanted to move away from Tumblr.
